			Plot
			The story revolves around Motu and Patlu, two friends living in Furfuri Nagar.[5] The show focuses on how the two have a penchant to land themselves in comical situations, later rescuing themselves only by sheer luck. Samosas are Motu's favourite food, and he frequently tries to steal them from the local Chaiwala who makes the best samosas in the city. Motu is mainly the black sheep of the duo, unintentionally creating problems while Patlu is always the one to solve them. Sometimes, the characters Ghasitaram, Chingam and Dr. Jhatka aid them. However, Ghasitaram at times misdirects and swindles them by making them try Dr. Jhatka's vast repertoire of quirky gadgets and gizmos. After Motu eats samosas, he temporarily gains more energy and strength than he normally has.

			The main antagonist of the series is a criminal named "John the Don" who is always accompanied by his two dull-witted henchmen, Number One and Number Two. John intends to become a don, but his plans always fail due to the heroic actions of Motu and Patlu, who trap and expose him and his plans Tit for Tat.

			Motu: Motu is a plump man who serves as the one of the show's central protagonists. He likes to eat samosas which provides him power. He is a gardener. Motu's best friend is Patlu. He often lands in trouble because of his actions. He is always looking for the easiest way to earn money, have fun and get to eat a lot of samosas, even if it means landing himself in trouble. Sometimes he gets over-expressive while celebrating his victory and can do something very foolish, like bringing back a pirate into the present who they had sent recently back to the past. He is also shown bragging about something he has never done. But he is a good-natured man who wants to help others. He wears a red tunic with a navy blue (though mostly black) vest, yellow Pyjamas, and shoes. His talking accent looks influenced by Dara Singh. When he eats samosas, he gets extra energy like Chhota Bheem and can defeat anyone in the world. He is depicted as extremely afraid of mice. His father is believed to have been abducted by extraterrestrials from Axar during his search for extraterrestrial lifeforms in the universe.
			Patlu: Patlu is a slim man who serves as the one of the show's central protagonists. He is often portrayed as the smartest guy in the city. He often gets into trouble along with Motu but he manages to help himself and Motu when they land in trouble. He always advises Motu to be in their normal track and thus lead a "danger-free" life, but he can always be coaxed (or forced) by Motu into helping him. He dislikes samosas but loves to read newspapers. It is also believed that his grandfather was a boxing champion and had a recipe for procuring extraordinary strength, which is later discovered by Motu. He wears a yellow tunic with orange leggings, brown-framed glasses, and brown shoes.
			Dr. Jhatka: Dr. Jhatka is an eccentric scientist. His accent is like a sardar, so he is referred as a Punjabi. His inventions are usually very impressive, but are of little use to the townspeople. In fact, more times than not they end up landing someone in trouble. He drives a yellow flying car. Jhatka is known by his balding hair, green shirt, violet neck tie, and blue jeans. His grandfather is shown to be a millionaire searching for the whereabouts of his grandson in Furfuri Nagar; he almost falls into the sly, pretentious and crafty John's trap, who pretends to be his scientist grandson. His design is a parallel version of Motu.[6] Sometime he tests his gadgets on Motu and Patlu without telling them any information about it and they get into problems because of it. Later he creates an antidote and uses it to make them normal like before. He often gets beaten by Motu and Patlu because of it.
			Ghasitaram: Ghasitaram has 20 years of experience in every field but only very few of the experience is useful to anyone. He hails from Ghatal located in West Midnapore in West Bengal. Almost like Dr. Jhatka, his so-called "experiences of 20 years" often land people, especially Motu and Patlu, in trouble. However, Motu and Patlu do call on him for help in certain episodes. Ghasitaram helps Dr. Jhatka with experiments and coaxing Motu and Patlu to test Dr. Jhatka's inventions. His design is a parallel version of Patlu. He wears a cobalt blue tunic, purple dhoti, dark brown vest, and shoes of the same color.

When he fires his gun in the air after telling his dialogue, coconuts fall on his head and makes him fall to the ground. He drives a green motor bike and sometimes also drives a police jeep. He is sometimes helped by two constables, Hera and Pheri. As of the movie "Motu Patlu: Double Trouble", he is married. Chingum wears a khaki uniform with metals and a nametag on it.

			Chaiwala: A man who has a tea-shop near Motu's house. His real home is never revealed in the series. He makes Motu's favorite samosas and Patlu's favorite tea in the city. Motu steals the samosas from his shop and does not give the money to him. Motu gets a lot of power by eating samosas of Chaiwala. After eating samosas he shows aggression and can beat anyone, although the Chaiwala does not like his samosas to be eaten for free. He occasionally rewards Motu by exempting him from the money Motu owes him or even promising him free samosas when he saves him from other residents of Furfuri Nagar. Motu sometimes gets beaten for not giving money to Chaiwala.
			John: John serves as the main antagonist of the show. John's ambition is to become a Don. But his plans always fail very badly and thus end up in him getting arrested or being taunted by other people. He writes some short poems.
