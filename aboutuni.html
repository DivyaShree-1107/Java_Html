				History
				In India, the state governments are responsible for education in their states. Development and monitoring of universities is in the mandate of a state government. In view of improving the quality of technical education in Karnataka, the state government passed the VTU Act in 1994 which led to formation of VTU and its dedication to technical education. VTU's mandate is defined as:[22]

				Promote planned and sustainable development of technical education consistent with state and national policies
				Design need based programs that ensure adequate human resource of the right kind
				Establish objective evaluation and certification systems for students programs and institutions
				Collaborate with national and international institutions, R&D establishments, organizations like AICTE, MHRD, UGC, industry and user agencies
				The VTU Act vested authority to VTU as the sole affiliating university for technical education in the state. All the colleges in the state that offered technical programs, mostly affiliated to regional state universities, were obligated to shift affiliation to VTU. Notable exceptions to the VTU Act include, but are not limited to, University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering (affiliated to Bangalore University), National Institute of Technology Surathkal, and Manipal Institute of Technology.

				Autonomy cell

				Autonomous colleges
				'Autonomy' implies that the college has the freedom to set its own syllabus, evaluation system, and grading system, but the degree awarded will be by the university. This degree differs from the degree awarded by non-autonomous colleges, with the difference being that the college name is boldly marked as 'Autonomous'.

				The Karnataka state has 18 autonomous engineering colleges affiliated to Visvesvaraya Technological University, Belagavi.

				All the 'autonomous colleges' follow a system of absolute grading or relative grading. The final score is calculated as a GPA.

				Non-autonomous colleges
				All the affiliated 'non-autonomous' colleges assess the students by a marking system. An aggregate score is calculated out of 100 as a percentage. All the subjects get equal weight. The final score is not calculated as a GPA but is instead awarded classes according to the marks obtained.

				The classes awarded to the students of non-autonomous colleges are:

				Class Awarded	Marks Range	Abbreviation
				First Class with Distinction	70 – 100	FCD
				First Class	60 – 69	FC
				Second Class	35 – 59	SC
				Fail	< 35	Fail
