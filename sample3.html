The simplicity of the competitions, and the lack of a need for expensive equipment, makes athletics one of the most commonly competed sports in the world. Athletics is mostly an individual sport, with the exception of relay races and competitions which combine athletes' performances for a team score, such as cross country.

			<h3> Kho-Kho</h3>
				<p>Kho kho is a popular tag and ancient sport invented in India. It is played by teams of 12 nominated players out of fifteen, of which nine enter the field who sit on their knees (chasing team), and 3 extra (defending team) who try to avoid being touched by members of the opposing team. It is one of the two most popular traditional tag games in the Indian subcontinent, the other being Kabaddi.[1] Apart from the Indian subcontinent, it is also played by the Indian community in South Africa.[2] Kho-kho is a traditional Indian sport, a form of tag, that is one of the oldest forms of outdoor sport, dating back to prehistoric India. The origin of Kho-Kho is very difficult to trace, but many historians believe that it is a modified form of 'Run Chase', which in its simplest form involves chasing and touching a person. Originating in Maharashtra, Kho-Kho in ancient times was played on 'raths' or chariots and was known as Rathera.[3]
