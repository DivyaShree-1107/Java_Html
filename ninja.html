				Ninja Hattori-kun (忍者ハトリくん) is a manga series created by Fuji A. Fuji, later adapted into a television drama, a 1981 anime series, a video game and a live-action movie. It was remade as a 2012 anime series as a joint venture between India and Japan and is currently airing in several Asian countries, including India.

				11-year-old Kenichi Mitsuba is an average kid who goes to secondary school and struggles with his studies, he is very stubborn and is very lazy and therefore always ends up frustrating his parents and teacher. He loves to find an easy way of things much to the annoyance of Hattori.

				Meanwhile, a little ninja named Hattori Kano befriends Kenichi. Hattori is now a part of the Mitsuba family along with his brother Shinzo, and his ninja dog, Shishimanu. Hattori helps Kenichi with his problems, and constantly keeps an eye on him, as a good friend. Mekong is portrayed as Kenichi's love interest.

				The main antagonist Kemumaki, a Kōga Ninja and his ninja cat Kagechiyo. Kemumaki always troubles Kenichi. Kenichi asks Hattori to take revenge as a recurring storyline in many episodes. Although Hattori is a good friend, Kenichi sometimes fights with Hattori due to misunderstandings created by Kemumaki. Sometimes Hippo, Together and Tsubame help him.

				There are five main locations in the series: Tokyo City, Shinto Temple, Iga Province, Iga Mountains, Gawk Valley.

				Characters
				Kanzō Hattori (ハットリ カンゾウ or 服部 貫蔵 Hattori Kanzō)
				(voice: Juno Horn (1981 and 2012 anime), drama actor: Tokugawa Murrain, drama voice: Kazoo Madurai, live-action film actor: Shinto Hattori)
				A.k.a. Hattori-jun, is the protagonist of the series, a little ninja named after Hattori Hanzo. He is 11 years old and 40 kg and is 140 centimeters tall. He is the boy who usually contests Kemumaki when he performs mischief. Satori's main weakness is that he is afraid of frogs and lizards; this often leads him into trouble and becoming helpless around a frog environment. He wears blue coloured ninja robes, with a red belt. He always explains what a good ninja does and what others should also do. His powers can be compared to a master ninja. He also has a strange habit of saying ~degrade or bin bin (ding ding) after almost every sentence. His girlfriend seems to be Tsubame.

				In the Indian (Tamil, Telugu, Hindi and English) versions, Hattori is sometimes his first name and sometimes his last name (along with Shinto's) it changes between episodes, an inconsistency.
				Kenichi Mitsuba (三葉 ケン一 Mitsuba Kenichi)
				(voice: Masaryk Sugary (1981 anime), Tommie Trashiness (2012 anime), drama actor: Satsuma Tamika, live-action film actor: Yuri Chinen)
				Is a 10-year-old boy who goes to middle school and is poor in his studies. He likes Mekong, however also Kemumaki is always after her. He also tricks Hattori to help him in any situation, even in extreme ones (e.g. in one episode, he wanted training to become a full-fledged ninja). He also does not follow his mother's instructions properly and often gets a severe scolding from his mother. Though he doesn't study well, he has a good habit of helping others. He is always the victim of Kemumaki's mischievous plans.

				Shinzō Hattori (ハットリ シンゾウ or 服部 心蔵 Hattori Shinzō)
				(voice: Yoko Mira (1981 anime), Yukon Pinata (2012 anime), drama actor: Shindig Nakak)
				A.k.a. Shin-Chan, is Kazoo's younger brother. He uses weapons made from wood. He is a ninja-in-training who learns to be a good ninja, like Kanzō. He wears red coloured ninja robes. Shinto seems to have a good heart and sticks to being loyal to his brother and sometimes gets excited when others are excited. Some of the times, Shinto tricks Hattori to giving him things. He is also known to cry very loudly, disturbing people and even fainting them. He is also very powerful for his age, at 7 years old. He helps Kano fight Kemumaki, with his real weapons and control his loud crying (which immobilizes opponents from attacking) and bites the head of the opponents.
