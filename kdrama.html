				started to broadcast television series in the 1960s. In the 1990s traditional historical series transformed into the present miniseries format, creating the notion of fusion sageuks.

				One director usually helms Korean dramas and is written by one screenwriter, thus having a distinct directing style and language, unlike American television series, where often several directors and writers work together.[3] Series set in contemporary times usually run for one season, for 12−24 episodes of 60 minutes each. Historical series may be longer, with 50 to 200 episodes, but they also run for only one season.

				The broadcast time for dramas is 22:00 to 23:00, with episodes on two consecutive nights: Mondays and Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, and weekends. Different dramas appear on each of the nationwide networks, Seoul Broadcasting System (SBS), Korean Broadcasting System (KBS), Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) and on the cable channels, Joongang Tongyang Broadcasting Company (jTBC), Channel A, tvN, and Orion Cinema Network (OCN).

				The 19:00 to 20:00 evening time slot is usually for daily dramas that run from Monday through Friday. Dramas in these slots are in the telenovela format, rarely running over 200 episodes. Unlike American soap operas, these daily dramas are not also scheduled during the day-time. Instead, the day-time schedule often includes reruns of the flagship dramas. The night-time dailies can achieve very high ratings. For example, the evening series Temptation of Wife peaked at 40.6%, according to TNS Korea.[4]

				Korean dramas are usually shot within a very tight schedule, often a few hours before actual broadcast. Screenplays are flexible and may change anytime during production, depending on viewers' feedback, putting actors in a difficult position. Production companies often face financial issues.

				Sageuk
				Main article: Sageuk
				Sageuk refers to any Korean television or film drama that is either based on historical figures, incorporates historical events, or uses a historical backdrop. While technically the word sageuk literally translates to "historical drama", the term is typically reserved for dramas taking place during Korean history.[5]

				Since the mid-2000s sageuks have achieved major success outside of Korea.[citation needed] Sageuks including Dae Jang Geum (a.k.a. Jewel in the Palace), Yi San and Jumong enjoyed strong ratings and high satisfaction ratings in countries such Vietnam, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Fiji and Iran. Jumong, which aired on IRIB (Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting) in 2008, had 85% viewership.[6]

				Contemporary
				Often centred on a love story, series set in contemporary times put family ties and relationships in the focus. Characters are mostly idealised, with Korean male protagonists described as handsome, intelligent, emotional and in search of "one true love". This has also been a contributing factor to the popularity of Korean dramas among women, as the image of Korean men became different from that of other Asian men.[3][7][8][9]

				History

				Actress Lee Young-ae played the titular Dae Jang Geum in the series of the same name.
				Radio broadcasting, including the broadcasting of radio dramas in Korea, began in 1927 under Japanese rule, with most programming in Japanese and around 30% in Korean.[10] After the Korean War, radio dramas such as Cheongsilhongsil (1954) reflected the country's mood.[11]

				Television broadcasting began in 1956 with the launch of an experimental station, HLKZ-TV, which was shut down a few years later due to a fire. The first national television channel was Korean Broadcasting System (KBS), which started up in 1961.[12] The first Korean television film was a 15-minute piece titled The Gate of Heaven (천국의 문, Cheongugui mun), on HLKZ-TV.[13]

				The first television series was aired by KBS in 1962. Their commercial competitor, Tongyang Broadcasting (TBC), had a more aggressive program policy and aired controversial dramas as well.[14] The first historical TV series aired was Gukto manri (국토만리), directed by Kim Jae-hyeong (김재형), depicting the Goryeo era.[15][16] In the 1960s, television sets were of limited availability, thus dramas could not reach a larger audience.[17]

				In the 1970s, television sets started to spread among the general population, and dramas switched from portraying dramatic historical figures to introducing national heroes like Lee Sun-shin or Sejong the Great.[17] Contemporary series dealt with personal sufferings, such as Kim Soo-hyun's influential Stepmother (새엄마, Saeeomma), aired by Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) in 1972 and 1973.[18] As technology and funding was limited, Korean channels could not make series in resource-heavy genres like action and science fiction; American and other foreign series were imported instead.[19]
