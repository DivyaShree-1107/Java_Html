			Synopsis
			Oggy, an anthropomorphic cat, would prefer to spend his days watching television and eating, but is continuously pestered by three roaches, Joey, Dee Dee and Marky (all named after members of the punk rock band Ramones). The Cockroaches' slapstick mischief ranges from plundering Oggy's refrigerator to hijacking the train he just boarded. There are two additional main characters: Oggy's cousin Jack, who is more violent and short-tempered than him and is also annoyed by the Cockroaches; and Bob, a short-tempered bulldog who is Oggy's neighbor.

			Characters
			Main
			Oggy is a cat with a light blue body, green eyes, grey tummy and white feet. Oggy usually spends his time either watching TV or doing housework — when not chasing the cockroaches. Despite the constant mayhem caused by the cockroaches, Oggy has developed a sort of love–hate relationship with them, having lived with them for a long time. Whenever he finds himself alone in his house, he will eventually begin to miss the cockroaches along with their pranks (as seen in the episode "Priceless Roaches","So Lonely" and "Alone At Last") followed by nothing interesting happening in his life. Oggy's house appears bigger on the inside, mainly featured in the roller coaster-like staircase scenes. According to executive producer Marc du Pontavice and France Info, the character of Oggy was named after punk rock musician Iggy Pop[2] and the rock album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars.[3][4] In early episodes, Oggy, like his "predecessor" Tom in Tom and Jerry, was the main punching bag in the series. However, in more recent episodes, Oggy has been portrayed as heroic, often triumphing over the cockroaches despite the beatings he takes from them and Bob. Notable other accomplishments include winning the Formula 1, placing first in a marathon, and ultimately winning over his girlfriend Olivia.
			The Cockroaches are three brothers who antagonize other characters, mainly Oggy and Jack. The cockroaches love pranking them so much, that if the cats were to leave, they would miss them (as seen in the episode "Moving Out"). It is also implied that the roaches are named after members of the rock band, The Ramones.
			Joey (born 15 June 1991)[5] is a purple-pink body, purple-blue head roach with a pink right eye (originally red) and yellow left eye, and the oldest brother. Even though he's the smallest roach in the group, most of the time he's the most intelligent, always being the brain in the plans, but is sometimes forced to go solo, because his brothers often think that his plans are stupid. He loves money, but his efforts always fall short, usually ending with him getting swatted or beaten up.
			Marky is a suave heartbreaking, silvery-grey body, green head roach with pink eyes (originally red, but returned in the ending of the episode "Teleportation" where he is stuck in the ice cubes); he is the tallest and middle brother of the three roaches and often doesn't really care about what the two others are doing. While he originally used to love causing mischief just like his brothers, he has grown to be more laid-back in later episodes, though he still enjoys hanging out with Joey and Dee Dee and causing general mayhem like he has always done. His hobbies are dating puppets and reading books. He also has bad breath, as revealed in the season 1 and season 6 episode "It's A Small World" and "Itsy-Bitsy Oggy" .
			Dee Dee is the ever-hungry cockroach and youngest of the three. He has a blue body, orange head and green eyes. His appetite sometimes reaches insane proportions, often resulting in the consumption of larger animals or other things that would otherwise be inedible (such as hyenas in one case and, due to the effects of a poisonous mushroom in another case, an insect. Other instances include the fish on the wallpaper "Oggy's Clone","Oggy's Costume" and a clownfish in "Scuba Diving"). He is known to like opera. Sometimes it is shown that his feet are so foul-smelling, the juice they produce is toxic and melt objects (like the Xenomorphs from the Alien franchise when they have acid for blood).
			Jack has an olive green body, yellow eyes, pale Salmon pink tummy and white feet, in the show. He is like the complete opposite of Oggy, as he is more short-tempered, violent and arrogant than him – a perfect target for the roaches to annoy. He often finds himself building huge machinery, such as roach-catching contraptions, most of the time resulting in them backfiring, making him less lucky than Oggy in most situations. He is also very interested in chemistry (that is, the more explosive parts of it). Jack often sleeps over at Oggy's house. At times, he bullies Oggy. Jack seems to be the strongest character in the show. He likes to show off, challenge the roaches and date girls – mainly Oggy's sister Monica. He is sometimes seen trying to propose to Monica, but the cockroaches' pranks always make him stop short. In one episode, they seem to have a baby together and ask Oggy to babysit their child. Jack also has a morbid fear of heights, as shown in several episodes like the season 4 episode "The Lighthouse Keeper". However, in the season 1 episode "The Rise & The Fall" Oggy has a fear of heights instead of Jack.
			Recurring
			Bob is a fierce brown bulldog and Oggy's neighbour. He has severe anger management issues. A running gag in the show has Oggy or Jack doing something that accidentally crushes Bob or shaves his fur or destroys his house, with Bob then pummeling Oggy or Jack off-screen. He does not always pummel Oggy, as seen in "Baby Boum", "Special Deliveries" and "To Serve and Protect". He has some sort of friendship with them, as notably seen in Olivia and Back to the Past!. He is known to like boxing.
			Olivia is a white cat (also mainly wearing a yellow bow on her head), who is Oggy's new neighbour and new love interest introduced in season 4. She loves nature, even Oggy's main enemies, the cockroaches, leading to Oggy acting nice to them every time she's around. She is aware of their mischief, so she does stop them when they are around by using some aggressive methods, from her anger to even an painful-looking fly swatter. She always breaks down when someone hurts any part of nature. She also cares a lot about her looks, as seen in the episode "Olivia's Pimple", where when she saw a pimple on her face, she refused to leave her house. In the season 4 finale episode "Oggy Is Getting Married (Featuring Olivia)", as the episode title implies, Olivia and Oggy get married after a trip to Venice, Italy.
			Oggy's grandma is a very rarely seen character only appearing in three episodes; "Granny's Day" in season 1 and "Oggy's Grandma" in season 3, where she appears to be very strict with Oggy's mannerisms and in "Deep Trouble" beside Monica, as they support Oggy and Jack. In the episodes Granny's Day and Oggy's Grandma, she attacks the cockroaches, and is actually attacked by them in Oggy's Grandma, one time being her head flattened by the lid of Oggy's toilet. She also gets frequent, short lasting bursts of energy from coffee, which aids her in defeating the cockroaches. In Granny's Day, she captures Joey and Marky, but feels sympathy for them, when Dee Dee cries on a picture of them with Joey and Marky crossed out. She is the least seen member of Oggy's family except for Oggy's parents, who were seen in a picture in "Oggy's Grandma". Oggy's grandma is the only female character to appear on the show to intentionally want to kill/defeat the cockroaches.
			Monica is Oggy's twin sister and Jack's love-interest. In one episode "Don't Rock The Cradle", they seem to have a child together. She visits Oggy's house every now and then. She is well known for being very active and likes to take on physical challenges such as sky diving and bungee jumping. She's always seen skating around on her inline skates. Out of all the main characters, she has the least number of appearances; even fewer than Bob. Monica has rarely appeared onscreen with the cockroaches or Bob (until her cameo only with Bob at the end of the 4th-season finale episode "Oggy is Getting Married! (Featuring Olivia)"). In the show's Hindi dubbed version, Monica is instead introduced as Oggy's childhood friend, which might be a glitch. After Season 2, she's only appeared in two other episodes, them being "Deep Trouble". In a Season 3 episode, she's instead seen wearing a magenta skirt and shoes instead of her rollerskates. This also marks her first appearance without them since her latest appearance in the season 2 episode "Don't Rock The Cradle". This also marks her first appearance without her baby in a later episode who, as mentioned before, also originated from that episode. The second and latest appearance after season 2 was the season 4 finale "Oggy Is Getting Married (Featuring Olivia)", where she makes a brief appearance at Oggy and Olivia's wedding as she sits next to Bob. It is unknown, but it is easier to assume she split up with Jack, as their child has never been seen again, that they've never been seen together or have been talking since season 2 and that during that same episode, Jack is staring/ogling at his new partner. She soon became friends with Olivia as in episode of Season 7, "Sharing Oggy".
			Lady K is a light yellow female cockroach introduced in the season 4 episode "Lady K", and the roaches' new love interest (mainly Joey). She's the cockroach that lives in Olivia's house, by which Olivia is not aware of. She hates Olivia. She use the cockroaches as her pawns to get what she wants or to get her job done.
			Bobette is the daughter of Bob who is introduced in Season 5. She is Jack's love interest, as seen in the episodes, " Marky's Tournament", and "Jackromeo and Bobette". She is seen in the episode, "Emperor for a Day" as Napoleon's love interest.
